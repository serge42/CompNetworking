This implementation is able to solve A and CNAME queries both recursively and iteratively. 
The implementation is made Object Oriented with a main class being LocalDNS.
The implementation of the Cache has been made in another class called Cache which holds instances of CacheEntries
to simplify the computation of the expiration of the chached records.

The LocalDNS contains three different caches for A queries, CNAME quesries and NS queries and uses the Parser classes 
founrnised during the course. A few modifications have been implemented in the DNS class :
 - modification of the length of the data buffer to accept queries ending with a point (.) since they are valid DNS queries.
 - Addition of addAllAnswers and addAllAdditionnal methods to simplify the copy of collection of data
 - Addition of a "clone" method (and implementation of the Clonnable interface) to permit copies of DNS objects.

Limitations:
- The LocalDNS cannot correctly resolve iterative NS queries if the queries are cached in the CNAMECache, since it first needs to resolve
  the cannonical name of the query.
- Many Exceptions are ignored.
- During iterative queries, some information could be retreived from cache but are not (like the NS servers for TLDs, etc.)
